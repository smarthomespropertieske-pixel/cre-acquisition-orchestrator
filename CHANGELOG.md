## [2.8.5](https://github.com/ahacker-1/cre-acquisition-orchestrator/compare/v2.8.0...v2.8.5) (2026-05-27)

Redesigns the operator dashboard into one living "deal space" — a persistent frame you drive by
summoning agents — without touching the engine. Drop documents and the deal record auto-populates;
you only edit what the team flags. The deterministic offline demo (Parkview) remains the default
public path and needs no API keys; all changes are presentation plus three thin, guarded backend
hooks, and are backward-compatible.

### Features

* **Persistent "deal space" frame:** the old six-tab dashboard is replaced by one frame — deal header + a 7-step lifecycle spine (Intake → Diligence → Underwriting → Financing → Legal → Closing → IC) + a context-sensitive center stage + a right rail (live feed + "Your Team") + a command bar. The power-user knobs (runtime/scenario/Codex limits, criteria overrides, workflow presets, mission control, logs, timeline, partial-failure recovery) move into an Advanced drawer with dialog a11y (focus, Escape-close, body scroll-lock).
* **Intake with no manual entry:** dropping the rent roll / T12 / offering memo auto-extracts and auto-applies every trusted source-backed value (confidence ≥ 0.7, no conflict, validated, source-hash matched); only conflicts and low-confidence reads are flagged for inline edit, which persists with provenance + a decision-audit entry. One document-first front door — the numbers come from the documents, not a data-entry form.
* **Summon agents and watch them work:** click a teammate (rail), type a command, or tap a chip to open a slide-in agent panel that streams the agent's reasoning with an elapsed timer, renders its workpaper (summary / finding / verdict / caveats) with "open full workpaper," and echoes the task it was given — plus a follow-up box to keep tasking it (live Codex single-agent dispatch via `--agent`; offline replays recorded work). The live feed keeps running behind it.
* **Editorial-premium visual system:** a real type scale (tight display headlines, wide-tracked uppercase labels), hairline structure, and a four-state functional status color (live / done / review / blocked) layered on the monochrome brand so progress is legible at a glance.

### Bug Fixes

* **Intake "Your Team" rail is staffed:** the default landing stage previously read "No agents staffed"; it now surfaces the ingestion crew (Document Orchestrator + rent-roll / financials / offering-memo parsers), and team status keys on the agent id so each member's live state renders.
* **Agent panel completeness:** the promised elapsed timer is now populated from the agent's event span; the panel echoes the task it was summoned with; and a declined/failed live dispatch surfaces an actionable notice instead of sitting silently idle.
* **Honest operator copy:** the front-door promise matches the real flow, and a gated live review explains exactly which source-backed inputs to provide first.
* **"New Deal" is document-first too:** the prominent New Deal button still opened the legacy manual data-entry wizard, contradicting the "no data-entry form" intake promise above. It now opens the same document-drop front door — drop the package and the team fills + flags the deal record — while the step-through wizard is kept only for editing an existing deal (the redundant "Upload Package" header button folds into "New Deal").
* **Lower-friction first run:** the front-door header hides run-time chrome (the run-status chip, Run Demo, Stop) until a deal is open or a run is active, leaving one clear create path and a single demo entry; dropping a PDF now sets an honest expectation up front — "PDFs upload for one-click extraction" (they don't auto-fill like CSV/Excel rent rolls and T12s), with an in-flow note instead of a silently empty record; and the create step trades orchestration jargon ("mission" / raw workflow id) for plain language.

## [2.8.0](https://github.com/ahacker-1/cre-acquisition-orchestrator/compare/v2.7.0...v2.8.0) (2026-05-25)

Two themes: hardening the real-world document-drop journey, and shipping an honest open
evaluation harness that proves the live agents detect document-buried ("narrative") risks the
deterministic demo is blind to. The offline demo remains the default; all changes are
backward-compatible.

### Features

* **Real-world drop-flow hardening:** a messy real-world pile (T12s, rent rolls, offering memos, plus junk files) now flows through classify → extract → review → workflow → export with no crashes, silent skips, or confidently-wrong numbers. Vacant `$0` rent rows no longer deflate in-place rent averages (Excel and CSV paths); rent roll vs T12 is classified by document content, not just filename; oversized CSVs and corrupt/unreadable workbooks degrade to a graceful `parse_failed` (no hangs); local filesystem paths are redacted from parser errors; and Python-interpreter selection falls back resiliently. An automated smoke test (`npm run test:pile`) drives the nasty pile through the real parser and asserts a typed per-file outcome.
* **Threshold-driven IC verdict:** the deterministic engine now consults `config/thresholds.json` for dealbreakers (instead of scenario-baked text) and uses a deal-specific exit cap — fixing a clean deal that was wrongly marked FAIL.
* **Open evaluation harness (`npm run eval`):** scores the orchestrator on a benchmark of 8 synthetic deals (core-plus / value-add / distressed, with both determinable and narrative document-buried planted risks) against committed ground truth, and writes an honest trust report to `eval/results/{scorecard.json,TRUST-REPORT.md}`. An `npm run eval:offline` mode runs the no-API extraction + simulation layers. The report measures three non-equivalent layers — deterministic extraction, the simulation *fixture* (not reasoning), and live Codex agent reasoning — and reports where the system falls short.
* **Live narrative-risk proof + full 8/8 coverage:** the live (Codex) layer is proven on the hard, document-buried deals — it genuinely flags tenant concentration, insurance understatement, and missing Phase I that the deterministic fixture is structurally blind to. The live layer covers **all 8 deals**: **narrative red-flag recall 100%, determinable financial 100%, dealbreaker recall 100%, IC verdict 88% exact (7 of 8)**. Two honest soft spots remain: **model-dependent returns (IRR / equity multiple) at 50%** — genuinely assumption-driven, with the agents diverging from the reference model in both directions (some deals more optimistic, some more conservative) — and one borderline deal (`cp-insurance-understated`) whose verdict oscillates CONDITIONAL↔FAIL across runs. Nothing was tuned to flatter; ground truth is fixed and committed. See [eval/results/TRUST-REPORT.md](eval/results/TRUST-REPORT.md).

### Bug Fixes

* **eval:** hardened the live-workpaper extractor — source EGI from the OpEx analyst; match values to labels on the same line only (a value never binds across a line break); prefer going-in metrics over pro-forma/stabilized/exit/interest-only variants; and parse `DSCR (amortizing): X`. Backed by a required machine-parseable agent `## Metrics` block (amortizing-basis DSCR) and a threshold-driven verdict rule. These lifted live determinable-financial accuracy and IC verdict to target.
* **eval:** the live-workpaper extractor preserves the negative sign on IRR / equity multiple, so a distressed deal's correctly-reported `-99.0% IRR / -2.38x EM` is no longer read as `+99% / +2.38` (fixed `ds-occupancy-collapse` model-dependent scoring 0% → 100%; regression test added).

## [2.7.0](https://github.com/ahacker-1/cre-acquisition-orchestrator/compare/v2.6.0...v2.7.0) (2026-05-21)

A completion pass that closes the README "known limits", implements the ROADMAP near-term
priorities (1–5), and reconciles documentation/claims with the codebase. The deterministic
offline demo remains the default; all changes are backward-compatible.

### Features

* **Document intelligence:** text-based PDF extraction via a local `pdfplumber` bridge (`scripts/parse_pdf.py`) with per-field confidence, page-level provenance, and candidate-review status; scanned/image-only PDFs are detected and flagged for OCR rather than silently skipped.
* **Excel parsing:** merged-cell handling (unmerge + forward-fill before header detection) and image-only workbook detection; additional messy rent-roll/T12 parser fixtures (currency symbols, subtotal/total rows, trailing notes, synonym headers).
* **Review-grade workpapers:** workpaper quality gates (cited inputs, assumptions, calculations, caveats, reviewer signoff) with a new `schemas/workpapers/quality-gate.schema.json`, per-phase evidence-completeness scoring, IC-package red-flag drilldowns back to the originating workpaper/source, and richer Markdown/JSON IC export with source drilldowns, reviewer signoff, and package version history.
* **Source review:** field-level decision audit trail (timestamped approve/reject/waive history with cross-document conflict blocking) and field-level provenance deep links from approved inputs to the source snippet/location.
* **Live Codex runtime hardening:** per-agent retry/backoff, partial-failure semantics with re-run-only-failed agents, secret redaction at the logging boundary, a committed redacted sample manifest, and a `schemas/codex/run-manifest.schema.json` contract. Operator-visible "retry failed agents" recovery in the dashboard.
* **Deployment:** single-operator self-host serve path (`scripts/serve-prod.mjs`, `npm run serve`) that serves the built dashboard and the loopback API/WS together (loopback-default; not multi-tenant), documented in [docs/DEPLOYMENT.md](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md).
* **Contributor experience:** end-to-end "add a new specialist agent" guide, a dashboard architecture map, and a `npm run release:check` readiness gate.

### Bug Fixes

* Corrected the README "Validation Gate" type-check commands (npm 11 swallowed `--noEmit`); added a cwd-correct `npm --prefix dashboard run typecheck` script.
* Registered the 4 document-ingestion roles and the `self-review-protocol` skill in `config/agent-registry.json` (now reports the full 31 roles / 8 skills).

### Documentation

* Scoped the "19-section prompt anatomy" claim to the 21 acquisition specialists (orchestrators and ingestion roles use their own templates); reconciled the dashboard view table and PDF/known-limits wording with the implementation.
* Updated "By the Numbers" to 31 roles / 8 skills / 27 schemas / 5 workflows / 20 fixtures / 8 test scripts; added the Evidence extraction-review screenshot to the demo tour.

## [2.5.1] - Stale Source Evidence Gate

### Added

- Stale source evidence gate: workflow launches now surface stale source-evidence risk instead of allowing operators to proceed on outdated extracted values.
- Source readiness signal: the workspace carries source freshness into launch readiness so missing, stale, or unapproved evidence stays visible at the decision point.

### Changed

- Package baseline moved to `2.5.1`; current `main` builds on that tag with additional fixture and first-real-deal workflow work.

## [2.5.0] - Source-Backed Deal Intake

### Added

- Source-backed deal intake: XLSX/CSV rent rolls and T12s can become reviewable candidate deal fields with parser metadata, file hashes, confidence, and source-location provenance.
- Persisted extraction review: review-ready and applied document evidence can be reopened without re-running extraction.
- Approve and apply flow: underwriting-critical fields are selected, conflict-reviewed, and approved/applied explicitly before changing deal inputs.
- Release-grade parser coverage for XLSX parser fixtures, workspace review/apply persistence, and source-backed launch-readiness coverage.

### Changed

- v2.4's Acquisition Command, Swarm Goal Console, visible handoffs, workpapers, and IC package surfaces became the public demo shell around the new source-backed intake path.

## [2.4.0] - Agentic Deal Team Workspace

### Added

- Acquisition Command for package readiness, orchestration stage, team pulse, evidence state, and decision-package status.
- Mission intent persistence for acquisition goal, outcome intent, and recommended workflow.
- Visible `agent_message`, `agent_handoff`, `agent_review`, `agent_dependency`, and `phase_handoff` events.
- Deal Team view with human-readable team roles and active, filed, and queued status language.
- Workpapers and evidence as a first-class review surface tied to the IC package.

### Changed

- Completed sample runs now show the bundled evidence behind the package instead of implying live documents are missing.

## [2.3.0] - Operator Workbench

### Added

- Operator Briefing with best next move, source-backed input coverage, review queue, phase readiness, and workflow-level launch confidence.
- Deal Progression Guide with phase checklists, missing evidence, unlock logic, and recommended actions.
- Operator Command Bar with readiness state, blocker count, checklist progress, source-input coverage, and primary next action.
- Reliable upload queue with per-file upload status, progress, failed-file retry, and open-workspace path for partial success.
- Source-backed review with bulk selection of apply-ready fields and before/after deal-data changes before apply.
- IC Review Brief highlighting next decision, priority red flags, priority data gaps, and source-readiness warnings.
- Verified feature paths for dashboard-launched simulation runs and contract validation.

### Changed

- Embedded workflow launches stay scoped to the open deal instead of inheriting stale browser draft state from local storage.
- CSV/TXT/MD and supported XLSX rent-roll/T12 files remain source-backed extraction paths, while PDFs and unsupported workbook shapes are classified and routed for review.
- Chain verification, legacy CLIs, browser E2E startup, and Codex artifacts were hardened for the public release.

## Release Journey

This project has grown from agent architecture into a local-first acquisition workspace: first the orchestration catalog, then a usable dashboard, then live Codex-backed execution, then a document-first cockpit, then an operator workbench, then an agentic deal-team workspace, then source-backed deal intake, and now a first-real-deal workflow that makes uploaded rent rolls and T12s reviewable before they affect underwriting inputs.
